Project purpose is to cleanup html and css files.

Html is lacking a lot of semantic elements and css is cluttered with unnecessary classes and ids.

I've attempted to make the html code clearer by better labeling page elements, and adding accessibility elements such as alt tags and a page title.

I've taken css tags and condensed them down into more digestible sections
